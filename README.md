```lrc
[00:10.50] The fire in his belly is taking over
[00:15.80] He never watches the telly dressed or sober
[00:20.81] He really likes a tiff, give him a lift
[00:23.52] And he won't round now
[00:26.33] He gets me to the point its nearly over
[00:29.39] But somehow
[00:34.89] 
[00:31.28] Somehow I'd like to get to know him
[00:34.07] Somebody told me that I shouldn't claim him
[00:36.55] Somebody told me that I should let him go
[00:40.70] Baby somehow
[00:46.70] 
[00:51.43] I really hate to say this
[00:53.84] I can't wait 'til he gets older
[00:56.46] Then I can assure you we'll be fine
[00:59.09] I won't bow out
[01:01.68] I know nobody's perfect
[01:04.01] With love you gotta earn it
[01:06.99] But until then I guess we'll have to scream and shout
[01:33.49] 
[01:12.86] Somehow, I'd like to get to know him
[01:15.94] Somebody told me that I shouldn't claim him
[01:18.59] Somebody said I should let him go
[01:53.49] But they really don't know
[01:55.33] That sometimes I really wanna kill him
[01:58.20] I'd die if I wasn't with him
[02:00.86] Somebody said I should let him go, oh
[02:19.36] 
[02:15.49] Looking out on Casanova
[02:18.07] Well we got people coming over
[02:20.59] I couldn't care less about the mess
[02:23.34] Just pipe it down
[02:25.80] By now you should know it
[02:28.31] That I'm a girl who don't give a dis
[02:31.19] There comes a point even for me
[02:33.91] I got my pride
